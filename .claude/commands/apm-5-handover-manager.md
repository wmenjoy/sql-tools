# APM 0.5.1 - Manager Agent Handover Prompt
This prompt defines how Manager Agents execute handover procedures to transfer project coordination context to incoming Manager Agent instances when approaching context window limits.

---

## 1 Handover Protocol Overview
Manager Agent Handover Protocol enables seamless context transfer using a two-artifact system while Manager Agent Context Scope includes full project coordination awareness.
- **Handover File:** active memory context not in formal logs or other artifacts
- **Handover Prompt:** template with embedded instructions for incoming Manager Agent. 


---

## 2 Handover Eligibility and Timing
Handover procedures are only eligible when the current **complete task execution cycle** is finished. Manager Agent **MUST** have completed:

### Task Loop Cycle Completion Requirements
- **Task Assignment issued** AND **Implementation Agent execution completed**
- **Memory Log received back from User** with completed task results
- **Memory Log thoroughly reviewed** for task completion status, issues, and outputs  
- **Next action decision made** (continue with next task, follow-up prompt, ad-hoc delegation, or Implementation Plan update)

### Handover Blocking Scenarios  
**Handover requests MUST be denied when Manager Agent is:**
- **Waiting for task completion**: Task Assignment issued but Implementation Agent hasn't completed work yet
- **Waiting for Memory Log**: Implementation Agent completed task but User hasn't returned with Memory Log yet  
- **Mid-review process**: Memory Log received but review and next action decision incomplete
- **Any other incomplete task coordination step**

When User requests Handover during non-eligible timing: **finish current critical step** then ask if they still want to commence Handover Procedure.

**Denial Response Format:** "Handover not eligible. Currently [specific critical step in progress - waiting for task completion/Memory Log return/log review completion]. Will confirm handover eligibility upon completion."

## 3 Handover Execution Process

### Step 1: Handover Request Validation
Assess current coordination state using section §2 criteria. If not eligible → deny request with completion requirements. If eligible → proceed to context gathering.

### Step 2: Context Synthesis and Validation
Synthesize current project state by reviewing Implementation Plan for phase status, Memory Root for coordination history, recent Memory Logs for agent outputs and dependencies.

### Step 3: Artifact Creation
Create Manager Handover File and Handover Prompt using templates in section §4. Follow file organization in section §5.

### Step 4: User Review and Finalization
Present artifacts to User for review, accept modifications, confirm completeness before User executes handover procedure.

#### Handover Procedure Overview
After confirming completeness, User will open a new chat session, initialize a new Manager Agent instance and paste the Handover Prompt. This chat session will replace you as the Manager Agent for this APM session.

## 4 Manager Agent Handover Artifacts
Create Generate Handover Artifacts following these templates:

### Handover Artifact Overview
**Two distinct artifacts are created during handover:**
- **Handover Prompt**: Presented **in chat** as markdown code block for copy-paste to new session
- **Handover File**: Created as **physical markdown file** in dedicated directory structure

### Manager Handover Prompt Template
```markdown
# APM Manager Agent Handover - [Project Name]
You are taking over as Manager Agent X+1 from [Outgoing Manager Agent X].

## APM Context Integration Protocol
1. **Read .apm/guides/Implementation_Plan_Guide.md** to understand Implementation Plan structure and Manager Agent session-maintenance responsibilities, then **read Implementation Plan** ([path/Implementation_Plan.md]) for current phase status and task assignments
2. **Read .apm/guides/Memory_System_Guide.md** to understand Memory System structure and Manager responsibilities, then **read Memory Root** ([path/Memory/Memory_Root.md]) for phase summaries and coordination history
3. **Read .apm/guides/Memory_Log_Guide.md** to understand Memory Log structure and review responsibilities, then **read recent Memory Logs** from current/latest phase ([path/Memory/current-phase-directory]) for latest agent outputs and dependencies
4. **Read .apm/guides/Task_Assignment_Guide.md** to understand Task Assignment structure and agent coordination responsibilities
5. **State your understanding of the Project's state and your responsibilities** based on the guides and **await for User confirmation** to proceed to the next step. 
6. **Read Handover File** ([path/Manager_Agent_Handover_File_X.md]) for active memory context of the outgoing agent not captured in formal logs

## Cross-Reference Validation
Compare Handover File active memory against Implementation Plan current state and Memory Log outcomes. Note contradictions for User clarification.

## Current Session State
- **Phase:** [Name/Number] - [X/Y tasks complete]
- **Active Agents:** [Agent_Name with current assignments]
- **Next Priority:** [Task ID - Agent assignment] | [Phase summary] | [Plan update]
- **Recent Directives:** [Unlogged user instructions]
- **Blockers:** [Coordination issues requiring attention]

## User Verification Protocol
After context synthesis: ask 1-2 assurance questions about project state accuracy, if contradictions found ask specific clarification questions, await explicit User confirmation before proceeding.

**Immediate Next Action:** [Specific coordination task]

Acknowledge receipt and begin APM context integration protocol immediately.
```

### Manager Handover File Format
```yaml
---
agent_type: Manager
agent_id: Manager_[X]
handover_number: [X]
current_phase: [Phase <n>: <Name>]
active_agents: [List of active Implementation Agents]
---
```
```markdown
# Manager Agent Handover File - [Project Name]

## Active Memory Context
**User Directives:** [Unlogged instructions, priority changes, Implementation Agent feedback]
**Decisions:** [Coordination choices, assignment rationale, observed User patterns]

## Coordination Status
**Producer-Consumer Dependencies (unordered list):**
- [Task X.Y output] → [Available for Task A.B assignment to Agent_Name] or [Task M.N] → [Blocked waiting for Task P.Q completion]

**Coordination Insights:** [Agent performance patterns, effective assignment strategies, communication preferences]

## Next Actions
**Ready Assignments:** [Task X.Y → Agent_Name with special context needed]
**Blocked Items:** [Blocked tasks with description and affected tasks]
**Phase Transition:** [If approaching phase end - summary requirements and next phase preparation]

## Working Notes
**File Patterns:** [Key locations and user preferences]
**Coordination Strategies:** [Effective task assignment and communication approaches]
**User Preferences:** [Communication style, task breakdown patterns, quality expectations, explanation preferences for complex areas]
```

## 5 File Organization and Naming
Store Manager Agent Handover Files in `.apm/Memory/Handovers/Manager_Agent_Handovers/`. Use naming: `Manager_Agent_Handover_File_[Number].md`. **Handover Prompts are are presented in chat as markdown code blocks for copy-paste workflow.**
