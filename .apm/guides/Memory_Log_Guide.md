# APM 0.5.1 - Memory Log Guide
This guide defines how Implementation Agents log their work for Manager Agents and Users. Memory Logs capture task-level context using **Dynamic-MD** format.

Both Manager and Implementation Agents must read this guide during session initialization. Implementation Agents reference it when logging; Manager Agents use it when reviewing logs.

## 1. Memory System Variant Overview
Summary of the Dynamic-MD Memory System variant, its storage layout and log format:

- Storage: `.apm/Memory/` folder with subfolders `Phase_XX_<slug>/`
- Format: One `Task_XX_<slug>.md` file per task (Markdown)

Memory Logs are populated by Implementation Agents after each task execution or when blockers occur. Manager Agents review logs to track progress and plan next steps.

## 2. Dynamic-MD Variant Memory Log Format
All Memory Log entries must follow a precise structure to ensure clarity, traceability, and context retention. For Dynamic-MD systems, each log is in a dedicated file created empty by Manager Agent, then populated by Implementation Agent. Use parsable Markdown with YAML front-matter and minimal formatting. Include optional sections only when their front-matter boolean is true:

```yaml
---
agent: [Agent ID]
task_ref: [Task_ID]
status: [Completed|Partial|Blocked|Error]
ad_hoc_delegation: [true|false]
compatibility_issues: [true|false]
important_findings: [true|false]
---
```
```markdown

# Task Log: [Task Reference]

## Summary
[1-2 sentences describing main outcome]

## Details
[Work performed, decisions made, steps taken in logical order]

## Output
- File paths for created/modified files
- Code snippets (if necessary, ≤ 20 lines)
- Configuration changes
- Results or deliverables

## Issues
[Specific blockers or errors, include error messages if relevant, or "None"]

## Compatibility Concerns
[Only include this section if compatibility_issues: true]
[Any compatibility issues identified]

## Ad-Hoc Agent Delegation
[Only include this section if ad_hoc_delegation: true]
[Details of any agent delegation that occurred during this task]

## Important Findings
[Only include this section if important_findings: true]
[Project-relevant information discovered during work that Manager must know]

## Next Steps
[Follow-up actions or instructions for next agent or "None"]
```

## 3. Implementation Agent Workflow
Main responsibilities and workflow steps for Implementation Agents when working with the Memory System:

1. **Receive Task Assignment:** Manager Agent provides a task prompt via the User with the `memory_log_path` specified in the YAML frontmatter pointing to an empty log file.
2. **Execute Task:** Work on the assigned task as described in the Task Assignment Prompt. Complete the task or note any issues, blockers, or bugs that prevent completion.
3. **Update Log:** Fill in all required fields in the provided log file using the correct format defined in section 2.
4. **Report Outcome:** Notify the User of task completion or issues, confirming the Memory Log is updated.

## 4. Manager Agent Workflow
Main responsibilities and workflow steps for Manager Agents when maintaining the Memory System:

1. **Create Empty Logs:** At the start of each phase, create **completely empty** log files (or inline sections) for all phase tasks.  **DO NOT populate any content.** Implementation Agents will fill in the entire structure when executing tasks.
2. **Attach to Assignments:** Include the appropriate empty log file path (or inline section) with each task assignment prompt sent to Implementation Agents.
3. **Review Completed Logs:** When the User returns with a completed task, review the log content for:
  - Task completion status and quality
  - Any blockers or issues requiring attention
  - Outputs that inform subsequent task assignments
4. **Decide Next Action:** Based on log review, determine whether to:
  - Send follow-up prompt to same agent (if task was blocked or needs refinement)
  - Assign ad-hoc agent for specialized work or issue resolution
  - Continue with next planned task assignment (if all is well)

## 5. Content Guidelines

### 5.1. Writing Concisely and Effectively
- Summarize outcomes instead of listing every step
- Focus on key decisions and reasons, especially if plans changed
- Reference artifacts by path, avoid large code blocks
- Include code snippets only for novel, complex, or critical logic (≤ 20 lines)
- Link actions to requirements from the task description when relevant
- Include valuable explanations provided during task execution when they offer user insights

### 5.2. Code and Output Handling
- For code changes: show relevant snippets with file paths, not entire files
- For large outputs: save to a separate file and reference the path
- For error messages: include relevant stack traces or error details
- For configurations: note key settings changed and why

### 5.3. Issues and Blockers
When logging blockers or errors:
- Be specific about what prevented completion
- Provide actionable information for the Manager Agent
- Include error messages or diagnostic info
- Suggest potential solutions if possible

### 5.4. Example Quality Comparison

- Poor logging: "I worked on the API endpoint. I made some changes to the file. There were some issues but I fixed them. The endpoint works now."

- Good Logging:
```markdown
---
agent: Agent_Backend
task_ref: Task 2.3
status: Completed
ad_hoc_delegation: false
compatibility_issues: false
important_findings: false
---

# Task Log: Task 2.3 - API User Endpoint

## Summary
Implemented POST /api/users endpoint with input validation and fixed CORS issues blocking frontend requests.

## Details
- Added user registration route in routes/users.js using express-validator for email and password checks
- Updated server.js CORS settings to allow frontend integration  
- Tested endpoint with valid/invalid data to confirm validation and CORS fixes

## Output
- Modified files: routes/users.js, server.js
- Endpoint functionality: Accepts {email, password, name}; validates input; returns 201 on success, 400 on error
- Key validation logic added for email format, password length, and required name field

## Issues
None

## Next Steps
- Add unit/integration tests for validation and CORS
- Update API docs for new endpoint
```
