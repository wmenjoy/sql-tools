# APM 0.5.1 - Memory System Guide 
This guide explains how APM sessions store and evolve memory using the **Dynamic-MD** system.

Memory duties are assigned to the *Manager Agent* - who maintains the system. Details on individual Memory Log files reside in .apm/guides/Memory_Log_Guide.md.

## 1  Memory System Overview
The Dynamic-MD Memory System organizes memory with the following structure:

- **Storage layout:** Folder `.apm/Memory/` + `Memory_Root.md` + sub-folders `Phase_XX_<slug>/` in the `.apm/` directory
- **Log format:** One `Task_XX_<slug>.md` Memory Log per task
- **Summarization:** After each phase completes, an inline subsection is appended to the `Memory_Root.md` file summarizing the phase

**Memory Logs** capture granular, task-level context and are written by Implementation Agents after each task completion. See .apm/guides/Memory_Log_Guide.md for schemas and writing rules.

## 2  Manager Agent Responsibilities
Main responsibilities of the Manager Agent when maintaining the Memory System during an APM session:

1. Keep the Memory System structure (folders/logs) in sync with the current Implementation Plan. Update as Phases or Tasks change.

2. After each phase, create and append a concise summary referencing the relevant Memory Logs.

### Phase and Task Management
1. On phase entry, create `.apm/Memory/Phase_XX_<slug>/` if missing. For each task in the phase, create a **completely empty** Memory Log, following .apm/guides/Memory_Log_Guide.md:
    - `Task_Y_Z_<slug>.md`

**All Memory Logs for the current phase must be created BEFORE the first Task Assignment Prompt for each task.**
**Use task ID and title from Implementation Plan (exclude agent assignment).**
**Example: Task "Task 2.1 - Deploy Updates | Agent_Backend" → `Task_2_1_Deploy_Updates.md`**

2. After each task execution, review the Memory Log **populated by the Implementation Agent**, provided via the User.

3. At phase end, append a summary to `.apm/Memory/Memory_Root.md`:
    ```markdown
    ## Phase XX – <Phase Name> Summary 
    * Outcome summary (≤ 200 words)
    * List of involved Agents
    * Links to all phase task logs
    ```
    Keep summaries ≤30 lines.
